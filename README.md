# IS215-Group 4: ChatGPT Guessing Game

This simple guessing game uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate prompts and clues for the user to guess the word in a particular category.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads)
* A web server like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi)

### Installing

2. Place the cloned folder in your web server's document root.

3. Start the web server and open the game in your browser.

## How to Play

1. Click on the "Start Game" button to begin. It will generate a random category and ask the AI to suggest an answer for that category.

2. Once the AI has answered, you will be prompted to suggest ten short sentences that will serve as clues for someone to guess the category and the answer.

3. After entering the clues, the game will begin. You will be given the first clue and a text box to enter your guess.

4. If you guess correctly, you win! Otherwise, you will be presented with another clue. You have up to 10 chances to guess correctly.
